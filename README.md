# Super Simple Web Comic Site (SSWCS)
This is a super duper simple skeleton for a site for a webcomic with a winforms app dedicated to managing web comics.
It's really barebones, built on deprecated technologies, and made by me as a learning project.
My goal is to provide the simplest possible solution for people who aren't familiar with coding, to host their works online!

SSWCS uses a dedicated web service to allow you to upload your web comic on the provided site. Posts are stored as JSON files. The comics are stored as jpgs.

ToDo:
- Rewrite for MVC
- Rewrite service for WCF
- Add a basic style
- Add a configurator for people who don't want to dabble in code
- Write a how to for comic creators
